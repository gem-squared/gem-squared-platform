# GEM² Platform Specification

**Governance, Evidence, and Matrix Management**

A formal framework for autonomous AI software development with provable boundaries and epistemic honesty.

## What is GEM²?

GEM² transforms AI-assisted development from heuristic craft to formal engineering. Instead of hoping AI outputs are correct, GEM² provides **mathematical guarantees** through:

- **TPMN** — A "compiler" for prompts that validates inputs and verifies outputs
- **Dual-Gate Validation** — AI governs AI through TPMN_P (before) + TPMN_O (after)
- **Evidence-Based Completion** — Progress measured by evidence, not time
- **Epistemic Honesty** — AI must flag when it's extrapolating (EEF)

> **"Prompt Engineering → Prompt Compilation → AI: from Magic to Engineering"**

## Quick Start

Read the [GEM² Platform Specification](GEM²-platform-spec-v1.5.5-public.md) for:

1. **Core Philosophy** — Why evidence-based AI governance matters
2. **Formal Foundations** — The mathematical structures (tensors, matrices, laws)
3. **TPMN Compilation** — How prompt validation works
4. **Minimal Path** — 5 essential concepts + end-to-end example
5. **Glossary** — All symbols and terms defined

## Key Concepts

| Concept | One-liner |
|---------|-----------|
| **TPMN_P** | Validates prompt BEFORE AI runs |
| **TPMN_O** | Verifies output AFTER AI runs |
| **EEF** | Flags when AI extrapolates |
| **SPT** | Forbids illicit reasoning leaps |
| **Ω_accept** | {Verified, Buggy, Skipped} = "done" |

---

## The Core Insight

```
Traditional:  Prompt → AI → Hope
GEM²:         Prompt → TPMN_P → AI → TPMN_O → Trust
```

GEM² doesn't make AI smarter — it makes AI **provable**.
