# GEM² Platform Specification

**Governance, Evidence, and Matrix Management**

> **"Don't write prompts. Write specifications."**

A formal framework for autonomous AI software development with provable boundaries and epistemic honesty.

## What is GEM²?

GEM² transforms AI-assisted development from heuristic craft to formal engineering. Instead of hoping AI outputs are correct, GEM² provides **mathematical guarantees** through:

- **TPMN** — The Prompt Specification Language (PSL) that validates inputs and verifies outputs
- **Dual-Gate Validation** — AI governs AI through TPMN_P (before) + TPMN_O (after)
- **Evidence-Based Completion** — Progress measured by evidence, not time
- **Epistemic Honesty** — AI must flag when it's extrapolating (EEF)

## Three Pillars of PSL

| Pillar | What It Does |
|--------|--------------|
| **Grammar** | Formal syntax for AI instructions |
| **Protocol** | Dual-gate validation (TPMN_P + TPMN_O) |
| **Result** | Evidence-based completion criteria |

## Documentation

| Document | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [Platform Specification v1.6.0](GEM2-platform-spec-v1.6.0-public.md) | Core framework and formal foundations |
| [TPMN Epistemology v1.6.1](GEM2-TPMN-Epistemology-v1.6.1.md) | Theoretical foundations of TPMN |
| [TPMN User Manual v1.0.0](GEM2-TPMN-user-manual-v1.0.0.md) | Practical guide for using TPMN |

## Key Concepts

| Concept | One-liner |
|---------|-----------|
| **TPMN_P** | Validates specification BEFORE AI runs |
| **TPMN_O** | Verifies output AFTER AI runs |
| **EEF** | Flags when AI extrapolates |
| **SPT** | Forbids illicit reasoning leaps |
| **Ω_accept** | {Verified, Buggy, Skipped} = "done" |

## The Core Insight

```
Traditional:  Prompt → AI → Hope
GEM²:         Specification → TPMN_P → AI → TPMN_O → Trust
```

GEM² doesn't make AI smarter — it makes AI **provable**.
